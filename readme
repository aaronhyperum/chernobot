TODO:

- Finish servo code
- Finish camera code (ffmpeg)

- Convert to rust (multiple step process, lots of wishful thinking)
    - Use IOKit API to create a joystick library for Mac (maybe send PR to gilrs or reminisce)
    - Use Gfx to create a primitive render queue library (theia) or stick with conrod/imgui-rs and be sad
    - Use theia to create an 'OO' gui framework
    - Create extension to gui framework
    - Use extension to code a new GUI for the program and reimplement everything
    - hope and pray that ffmpeg and serial port works in rust
    - rejoice in a better language for the codebase and relax
